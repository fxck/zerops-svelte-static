    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # select what technology should the
      # build container be based on, can
      # be different from service technology
      # see docs for full list
      base: nodejs@18

      # *optional* add additional dependencies
      # on top of base technology (combination
      # will be cached for next build)
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something

      # build your application
      buildCommands:
        - npm i
        - npm run build

      # select which files / folders to deploy
      # after the build succesfully finished
      # `~` can be used to mark starting point
      # of deploy path, this example would deploy
      # files in folder dist without the folder
      # itself, either way make sure your nginx
      # config points to the correct folder
      deploy:
        - 'build/~'

      # *optional*: which files / folders
      # to cache for the next use
      cache:
        - node_modules
        - package-lock.json

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    # (usually no changes needed for a Static apps)
    # run:
      # *optional* install dependencies that your
      # runtime service requires (will be cached)
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something

      # *optional*: triggered before each start/restart
      # of your application, to eg. clean cache
      # initCommands:
      #  - rm -rf ./cache
